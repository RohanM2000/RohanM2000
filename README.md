# Hi! I am Rohan Mudumba 

## ***About me***

I am a recent astrophyics graduate from University of Cambridge. I have been pursuing a career in software engineering and am always looking for new opportunities to tackle challenging problems. I have a passion for breaking down seemingly impossible problems into doable chunks and piecing them together for elegant solutions.
- Iâ€™m currently learning ...
  - C++
- I am looking forward to contribute into related open source projects
- Aside from coding, you can find me writing papers on applying math to every day dilemmas, reading novels in japanese, playing chess, golfing, and weightlifting.
